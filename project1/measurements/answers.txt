Q2: Path Latency and throughput 

H1 - H4 communication

predicted 
latency - 170 - .17seconds
throughput -  15 mbps

actual: 
latency - 171.865 seconds 
throughput- 10.242 mbps 

explanation: 
my expectation for the latency was correct, being the time it takes for a 
packet to go round trip would be the addition for all the rtt. However that is 
not how the throughput is calculated as it measure the amount of data that can 
be transmitted in a specific duration of time. I added and that was incorrect. 
This is incorrect because the fact that with the increase number of rtt, the 
amount of data should be less than adding all of the throughput combined. not
necessarily know how to add them together, but as a reference, i think it should 
definately be less.  

** just random notes **
H1 -(S1)---(   L1   )---(S2)---(   L2   )---(S3)---(   L3   )---(S4)- H4 
    
    rtt      84  ms             25 ms               70 ms
throughput   4.478 mbps         4.4 mbps            7 mbps
 

3: Predicted Latency and throughput
2 pairs(h1,h4 and h7,h8)
h1 - h4: predicted rtt = 170 ms
rtt = 161 ms
throughput = 5.085

h7 - h8: predicted rtt = 170 ms
rtt = 161 ms
throughput = 16.542

3 pairs(h1, h4; h7, h8; h10, h9)
h1-h4: predicted rtt = 170 ms
rtt = 161 ms
throughput = 10.45

h7 - h8: predicted rtt = 170 ms
rtt = 161 ms
throughput = 7.24

h10 - h9: predicted rtt = 170 ms
rtt = 161 ms 
throughput = 4.48

Q4: Predicted Latency and Throughput

h1-h4: predicted rtt = 170 ms
rtt = 161 ms
throughput = 15.838

h5-h6: predicted rtt = 50 ms
rtt = 43 ms
throughput = 23.91
